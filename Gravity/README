Day 1: 

Kaitlyn used the GravCorrections notebook in the scripts folder to perform gravity corrections (drift, free air, bouguer) 

2022_Gravity in the data folder contains the raw data from 2022 and the corrected data 

Grav_corrected in the data folder is the .csv file of the corrected data (jupyter notebook downloaded this)

Day 2: 

Anna created separate scripts and data folders in the gravity folder (python notebooks go in the scripts folder and data files go in the data folder...)
