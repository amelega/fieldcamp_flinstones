Flinstones group repository for Mines Geophysics Field Camp 2025

## Group and Project: 
Anna, Jack D., Kaitlyn, Paige: Imaging a cave system, part 2: A tale of two wavefields â€“ Multiphysics, multifrequency imaging of Sulfur Cave, Steamboat Springs

# Day 1: 
- Kaitlyn performed gravity corrections (drift, free air, and bouger) on the 2022 gravity data collected
- Anna created/initiated this GitHub repository

# Day 2: 
- Kaitlyn created a map with the GPS points for the 2025 refraction survey, the 2022 gravity grids (group 1 and group 5), and began working on the GPR plotting
- Running into GPR GPS issues (funky coordinate systems)
- Paige began picking first arrivals for the 2025 refraction line after we talked with people from Collier Geophysics
- Jack uploaded all of the GPR data and loaded the 2024 100 MHz data into Geolytix

# Day 3: 
- Solved our GPS issues with GPR and plotted the survey grids onto Kaitlyn's map
- Paige continued to pick first arrivals and created a preliminary velocity model with her current picks
